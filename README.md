## Dependencies

### Required (Built-in)
- Python 3.6+

### Optional (for enhanced forensic support)
- `ewfmount` - For EnCase E01 image mounting
- `qemu-nbd` - For virtual disk image mounting
- `sudo` access - For mounting forensic images

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd Windows_11_WBEM_parser
```

2. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed:
```bash
python3 --version
```

3. Run the parser:
```bash
python3 wbem_parser.py <path_to_repository>
```

## Forensic Considerations

### Data Integrity
- All file operations are read-only
- Original data is never modified
- Hash values are calculated for verification
- Detailed logging tracks all operations

### Evidence Handling
- Supports standard forensic image formats
- Preserves timestamps and metadata
- Handles corrupted or incomplete data gracefully
- Provides detailed parsing logs for documentation

### Performance
- Processes large repositories efficiently
- Limits recursion depth to prevent runaway parsing
- Handles files up to several GB in size
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Repository path does not exist"**
- Verify the path is correct
- Check if using forensic images that need mounting
- Ensure proper permissions to access files

**"No core repository files found"**
- Repository may be in a subdirectory
- Files may have different case (INDEX.btr vs INDEX.BTR)
- Repository may be corrupted or incomplete

**Mounting failures with forensic images**
- Requires root/sudo access for mounting
- May need additional tools (ewfmount, qemu-nbd)
- Check if image file is corrupted

**Unicode/encoding errors**
- Some MOF files may use different encodings
- Parser attempts multiple encodings automatically
- Check parsing log for specific encoding issues

### Debug Mode
Add detailed debugging by modifying the log level in the source code or checking the parsing_log.txt file for detailed error information.

## üîç Threat Hunting Guide

### Quick Threat Assessment
1. **Run enhanced analysis**: `python enhanced_wmi_parser.py /path/to/OBJECTS.DATA ./analysis`
2. **Check threat level**: Look for CRITICAL or HIGH threat assessments in console output
3. **Review persistence chains**: Check `wmi_persistence_chains.csv` for complete attack chains
4. **Analyze IOCs**: Review `wmi_ioc_report.json` for actionable indicators

### Threat Level Interpretation
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate action required - likely active compromise
- **HIGH**: Probable malicious activity - investigate immediately  
- **MEDIUM**: Suspicious patterns detected - review for false positives
- **LOW**: Normal WMI usage - baseline review recommended

### Investigation Workflow
1. **Initial Triage**:
   - Run both parsers: `wbem_parser.py` and `enhanced_wmi_parser.py`
   - Review threat analysis summary for overall risk assessment
   - Identify high-risk persistence chains and suspicious objects

2. **Deep Analysis**:
   - Examine FilterToConsumerBinding objects for complete attack chains
   - Analyze script content in Event Consumers for malicious payloads
   - Cross-reference detected patterns with known APT TTPs
   - Check for deleted persistence objects in unallocated space

3. **Evidence Collection**:
   - Export all CSV files for documentation
   - Use IOC report for hunting across environment
   - Correlate findings with Windows Event Logs and Sysmon
   - Preserve forensic images for court proceedings

4. **Response Actions**:
   - Follow recommendations in threat analysis output
   - Remove malicious WMI subscriptions if confirmed
   - Hunt for lateral movement using extracted IOCs
   - Update detection rules based on findings

### Integration with SIEM/EDR
- Import CSV files into security platforms for correlation
- Use IOC JSON report for automated indicator feeding
- Create custom alerts based on detected APT signatures
- Monitor for similar patterns across environment
